I dont know where the things you wrote went, I cant see them.

We will see what happens next

Same here ... 

Git commandss
new project folder
git init - 
make required changes to your project 
git add .    / git add specific_file_name.xt
git commit -m "Added search function"
git commit -m "Fixed the addition bug"
---------------------------------------------------------Everything above has nothing to do with remote repos
git pull from set upstream branch/  just incase there is collabration / u try prevent or resolve conflicts if there are any 
git push
